This plugin is designed to help you automatically sort your party list in Final Fantasy XIV using a series of semi-complex rules about Job and Instance information in order to provide flexibility for various playstyles and content difficulty for a wide range of requirements. The plugin leverages the game's own built in `/psort` functionality and thus is entirely client sided.
